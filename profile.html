        <h3>What were you doing before the bootcamp?</h3>

        <p>
            Before the bootcamp, I had started self learning SQL through a Udemy course I found.
            I was interested in learning more to increase my technical knowledge, so I pursued a
            Cybersecurity Certificate that had SQL and Python courses as a part of the curriculum.
        </p>

        <p>
            I enjoyed working with Python and decided to utilize my Business Analytics minor to make a portolio
            during the process of learning Python. I found a Titantic dataset with information about the passengers
            on the Titanic and utilized some Python libraries, mainly Pandas & Matplotlib. I added Exception Handling,
            Data Visualization with graphs and insights found.
        </p>

        <p>
            I attended a WomenInTechnology conference called WITCON 2020, and through the job board on the platform
            learned about Apprenti. My curiosity and passion for technology led me to take the assessment for Apprenti
            and start the process of talking with Apprenti. Through Apprenti, I received the opportunity to talk to
            interview for an apprenticeship opportunity at Great American Insurance Group (GAIG) as a Java Software
            Analyst apprentice in QA.

        <h3>What has life been like in the bootcamp?</h3>
        <p>
            Life has been going fantastic in the bootcamp. I found it helpful to utilize what I know about GitHub,
            Python concepts, SQL, HTML, CSS, knowledge about cloud through the Cybersecurity Certificate as well as
            some knowledge on JSON and Java from previous.
        </p>
        <p>
            Having this knowledge has helped in learning and building upon the various technologies taught in the bootcamp.
        </p>

        <h3>What doing after the bootcamp?</h3>
    <p>
        After the bootcamp, I am looking forward to joining Great American Insurance Group as a Great American Software
        Analyst apprentice in QA.
